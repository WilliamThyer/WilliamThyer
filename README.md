### Hello and welcome to my github!

My name is William Thyer. I am a data scientist at a healthcare technology company. In 2023, I received my PhD in Psychology from the University of Chicago where I studied short-term memory and attention. I was a researcher in the [Awh/Vogel Lab](https://awhvogellab.com) from 2018-2023. I was previously a data science intern at [Spark Neuro](https://medical.sparkneuro.com/) in 2021 and at [Intuitive Surgical](https://www.intuitive.com/en-us) in 2022. You can access my [resume here](http://williamthyer.github.io/files/Thyer_William_Resume.pdf) and [my personal website here](https://williamthyer.github.io/). I like Python, machine learning, and cycling! üêçü§ñüö¥
