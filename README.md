### Hello and welcome to my github! 

My name is William Thyer. I am a 4th year PhD studying psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and data science in the Awh/Vogel Lab at the University of Chicago. I was a data science intern at [Spark Neuro](https://medical.sparkneuro.com/) in 2021. This summer, I'll be working as a data science intern at [Intuitive Surgical](https://www.intuitive.com/en-us). I like Python, machine learning, and cycling! üêçü§ñüö¥
