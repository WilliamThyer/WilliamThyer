### Hello and welcome to my github! 

My name is William Thyer. I am in the 5th and final year of my PhD studying psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and data science. I'm a member of the [Awh/Vogel Lab](https://awhvogellab.com) at the University of Chicago. I was previously a data science intern at [Spark Neuro](https://medical.sparkneuro.com/) in 2021 and at [Intuitive Surgical](https://www.intuitive.com/en-us) in 2022. You can access my [resume here](http://williamthyer.github.io/files/Thyer_William_Resume.pdf) and [CV here](http://williamthyer.github.io/files/thyer_william_cv.pdf). I like Python, machine learning, and cycling! üêçü§ñüö¥
